A simple to use responsive testimonials rotator that uses WP's native text widgets and a sidebar.

== Description ==
Think Up Testimonials rotator uses WP's native text widgets and a plugin created sidebar. Put your testimonials into individual
text widgets with the following markup.

<code><h3>Your nice quote from someone saying how great your or business are.</h3><h2>~ Andy Johnson</h2></code>

Place the text widget into the sidebar called 'Think Up Testimonials'. To output the testimonial rotator on the front end, insert
the function `thinkup_testimonials()`` into your theme template files where you want the rotator to appear.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `thinkup-testimonials` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the widgets page and place a normal text widget in the 'Think Up Testimonials' sidebar and add a testimonial using this mark up <code><h3>Testimonial text here</h3><h2>~ Author</h2></code>
4. Repeat step 3 as needed.
3. Place `thinkup_testimonials();` in your templates to output the rotator

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can you change the size of the testimonial or author text? =

Simply use your style.css of your theme to overwrite the plugin styles. Use the CSS selector #thinkup-testimonials h3 {...}
for the testimonial text and #thinkup-testimonials h2 {...} for the author text.

= How can you change the delay between testimonials? =

Right now there is no way to easily change the time delay. Hopefully this will be added in a future revision.

== Screenshots ==
